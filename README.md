## Curvy-Progress

I was looking for a curvy ProgressBar/SeekBar, the elements I found didn't satisfy me, so I did my own.

## How it works ?

I extended View and I used android.graphics.Path to build the curve, actually there are draw using a sinus function. The pulsation, frequency and period change to get a random aspect. 

I added some elements to show how it could render in a real app, there aren't working, only the curvy-progress is working.
